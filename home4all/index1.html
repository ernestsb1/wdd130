        We are doing our best to give this orphaned children access to education. We also have children from poor homes we fund their school fees. A popular proverb in Africa goes: it takes a village to raise a child. What this translates to in simple terms is that it takes the contribution of an entire village, community or nation, if you will, to raise a child. Our parents from two, three, maybe four generations ago experienced this form of nurture that fed from the combined effort of elders who handled instruction in the way of custom and tradition. What this system ensured was that every child met with knowledge within and without the walls of their home. </P>
