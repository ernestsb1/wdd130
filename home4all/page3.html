         <p class="our"
       <br> SB Children's Home is a place of love, care, <br> and support for children in need. Here, they can find a<br> second family, with house moms and dads, staff, and volunteers who <br> are dedicated to providing for their every need.

        At SB Children Home, children are <br> given the chance to thrive and grow, with access to warm showers,  nutritious meals, clean clothes, <br> and medical care.  All the children attend school outside the home in an effort to assimilate  them back to <br> the community over time. But SB is so much more than just  a place to live. Its a place  where <br>children  can feel safe, loved and valued, surrounded by  a community of people who care <br> about their well-being and future.  It’s a place where children can learn, grow, and <br> build the foundations for a bright and successful future. And it’s all thanks <br> to the dedicated staff, volunteers, and donors at Upendo Kids Village.</P>
