        We are doing our best to give this orphaned children access to education. We also have children from poor homes we fund their school fees. A popular proverb in Africa goes: it takes a village to raise a child. What this translates to in simple terms is that it takes the contribution of an entire village, community or nation, if you will, to raise a child. Our parents from two, three, maybe four generations ago experienced this form of nurture that fed from the combined effort of elders who handled instruction in the way of custom and tradition. What this system ensured was that every child met with knowledge within and without the walls of their home. </P>

        <br> SB Children's Home is a place of love, care, <br> and support for children in need. Here, they can find a<br> second family, with house moms and dads, staff, and volunteers who <br> are dedicated to providing for their every need.

        At SB Children Home, children are <br> given the chance to thrive and grow, with access to warm showers,  nutritious meals, clean clothes, <br> and medical care.  All the children attend school outside the home in an effort to assimilate  them back to <br> the community over time. But SB is so much more than just  a place to live. Its a place  where <br>children  can feel safe, loved and valued, surrounded by  a community of people who care <br> about their well-being and future.  It’s a place where children can learn, grow, and <br> build the foundations for a bright and successful future. And it’s all thanks <br> to the dedicated staff, volunteers, and donors at Upendo Kids Village.</P>
